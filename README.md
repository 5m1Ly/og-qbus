# OG Qbus
This is a the original copy of the qbus server including the qbus framework. All the contents of the *server* folder are untouched since there was last worked on the project.

I've decided to upload the project due to the commotion and discussion around the project about who the authors are, whether or not the project is based on the esx project, etc. The main purpose of this repo is to get answers to the questions that people have about the project.

## Project Age
The files within the project date back to June 1 of 2020 as stated by the date on which the FXServer.exe file was last modified.
